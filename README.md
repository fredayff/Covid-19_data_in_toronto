# Exploring COVID-19 data for Toronto, Canada
## STA303/1002 Data exploration assessment

### Introduction

This assessment is working with the most up-to-date COVID data for the City of Toronto.

### Aim
In tasks 1 and 2, the aim is to create versions of the ‘Cases by Day’ and ‘Cases by Outbreak Type and Week’graphs you can find on the Toronto COVID portal under ‘Daily Status of Cases’.

In task 3, the aim is to use data about Toronto’s neighbourhoods, drawn once again from the Toronto COVIDportal, this time under ‘Neighbourhood Maps’, as well as neighbourhood profile data from the 2016 census, from the OpenData Toronto portal.
