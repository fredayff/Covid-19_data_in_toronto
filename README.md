# Exploring COVID-19 data for Toronto, Canada
## STA303/1002 Data exploration assessment

### Introduction

For this assessment you will be working with the most up-to-date COVID data for the City of Toronto.

To complete this assessment, there are two documents you need to be aware of:

(1) this set of instructions (i.e., what you’re currently reading), 

and(2)sta303_data-exploration_template.Rmd a template you should save your on copy of.

The template will help you load the required data and has some helper functions for preparing your submis-sion for Crowdmark.

### Aim
In tasks 1 and 2, our aim is to create versions of the ‘Cases by Day’ and ‘Cases by Outbreak Type and Week’graphs you can find on the Toronto COVID portal under ‘Daily Status of Cases’.

In task 3 you will use data about Toronto’s neighbourhoods, drawn once again from the Toronto COVIDportal, this time under ‘Neighbourhood Maps’, as well as neighbourhood profile data from the 2016 census,from the OpenData Toronto portal.
